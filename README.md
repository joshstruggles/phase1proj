# Overview

Microsoft has decided to join the film industry and we are charged with the responsibility of finding out how best the company can dip their metaphorical toes into the depths of Hollywood. Our approach is to take a look at films that are considered to be "good" films, with an IMDB score of "7" or above, and an ROI of 5000% or higher. Once we have our sample size we will look to see if the genre and initial budget has anything to do with the success of other films, and how we can replicate some of that success for ourselves. 
# Business Problem
Microsoft historically has not been in the business of filmmaking however, change is on the horizon. From a business standpoint, we are responsible for the direction this film could potentially go in and without proper research, the success of Microsoft's first outing could prove problematic.
## Data

We utilized the IMDB database as well as the report builder function from thenumbers.com, an information bank that can assist us in creating relevant data for our research. 

## Key Points 

 -  Your analysis should yield three concrete business recommendations. The ultimate purpose of exploratory analysis is not just to learn about the data, but to help an organization perform better. Explicitly relate your findings to business needs by recommending actions that you think the business (Microsoft) should take.

 -  Communicating about your work well is extremely important. Your ability to provide value to an organization - or to land a job there - is directly reliant on your ability to communicate with them about what you have done and why it is valuable. Create a storyline your audience (the head of Microsoft's new movie studio) can follow by walking them through the steps of your process, highlighting the most important points and skipping over the rest.

 -  Use plenty of visualizations. Visualizations are invaluable for exploring your data and making your findings accessible to a non-technical audience. Spotlight visuals in your presentation, but only ones that relate directly to your recommendations. Simple visuals are usually best (e.g. bar charts and line graphs), and don't forget to format them well (e.g. labels, titles).
